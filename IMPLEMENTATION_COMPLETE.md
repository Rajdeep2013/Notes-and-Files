## SUPPORT INFORMATION

### If Issues Arise:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify CDN libraries loaded (F12 → Network)
3. Check file type and extension match support list
4. Verify file size not exceeding limits
5. Try different browser to isolate issue

### File Size Limits:
- Text preview: 1MB maximum
- DOCX preview: 5MB maximum
- Other formats: No limit (streaming)

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **XLSX not rendering?** Ensure SheetJS loaded from CDN

- **DOCX shows error?** Verify Mammoth.js loaded
- **Mobile not responsive?** Check viewport meta tag
